# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines resulting in unexpected results. The issue stems from an incorrect use of the `$group` stage, which leads to inaccurate counts or unexpected groupings of documents.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code showcases an aggregation pipeline designed to group documents by a specific field, count the occurrences of each group, sort the groups in descending order by count, and finally limit the results to the top 10. However, due to a subtle error in the pipeline, the resulting output deviates from the expected behavior.  The error leads to incorrect group counts or even unexpected groups being returned.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the corrected aggregation pipeline that accurately produces the intended results.
